README - publisher
------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'publisher' is a Java utility library to make private methods public type safely. In practice this
means that class interface can be designed properly (i.e. no unnecessary methods published) but
still unit tests can be written to test private methods. 'publisher' is meant to be used in unit
tests only. Of course it can be used anywhere but this, however, is not recommended.

DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY ANYWHERE IN PRODUCTION!
As mentioned, 'publisher' is made for unit testing purpouses only. If the target JVM has Java
security turned on problems are guaranteed. So, use 'publisher' for unit testing only.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Java 1.5 or later
